# simple-calculator

This calcultor does the simple calculations between two numbers such as:

1. Addition
2. Subtraction
3. Multiplication
4. Division
5. Remainder
6. Exponentiation

**Working**

The user selects the 'n' option and enters the two numbers.
Then select the Option of the function you want to implement.
The program closes after giving the result (it wasn't meant to do that, but it does :'( )
